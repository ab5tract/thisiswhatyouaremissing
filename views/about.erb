    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Complex systems of copyright and distribution create borders in digital space that follow the national borders of physical space. They do so by allowing or limiting access to Internet media content based on geographic location. These practices raise questions about globalization, citizenship on and offline, and the openness of the web. The fact that content access is tied to IP address further complicates these questions. For example, should a nation’s citizen be permitted to view the content of her or his country while travelling abroad? Furthermore, what does limiting distribution based on IP address achieve?

      This project examines the issues surrounding media access as dictated by commercial interests by highlighting the limits of accessibility on YouTube and amplifying the experience of frustration and powerlessness when access is denied.
